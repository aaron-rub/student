## Plan

### Purpose of the Project:
The purpose of the "Thiri" project is to develop source code for a camera application that functions similarly to PhotoMath. Thiri will leverage a device's camera to recognize and solve mathematical equations in real-time, serving as an educational tool and problem-solving assistant.

### Roles:

DevOps: As DevOps engineers, our role is crucial in setting up the infrastructure and deployment pipelines to ensure the smooth operation of Thiri. We will manage server infrastructure, configure CI/CD pipelines, and monitor application performance post-launch.

Backend: The backend development team, using Java, is responsible for implementing the server-side logic of Thiri. This includes creating APIs for equation recognition and solving, user authentication, and ensuring data security and compliance.

Frontend: The frontend development team, using JavaScript and frameworks like React, plays a pivotal role in designing the user interface of Thiri. Our objective is to create an intuitive and responsive interface that allows users to capture math equations easily, view solutions, and interact with the application seamlessly. The frontend development team will also be responsible for creating a webhook for the website that introdcues our features to new users.


### Stretch Plan
- Add a database that saves all equations that a user has had solved
- Grammar Check for English Assignments
- Calculator
