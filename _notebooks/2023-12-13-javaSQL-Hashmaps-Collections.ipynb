    "In Java, the `Collection` interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework and extends the `Iterable` interface. It includes methods for basic operations (such as `add`, `remove`, `clear`), bulk operations (such as `containsAll`, `addAll`, `retainAll`, `removeAll`), and array operations (such as `toArray`).\n"
