They define the structure and behavior of objects, serving as templates or blueprints from which objects are created. Java programs typically consist of multiple classes, each designed to fulfill a specific role. One Java class that you should be familliar with is: \n",

    "#### Java Objects\n",
    "An object in Java is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities. `Objects are the instances of a class that are created to use the attributes and methods of a class.`  A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of : \n",

    "\n",
    "When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class. But the values of those attributes, i.e. the state are unique for each object. A single class may have any number of instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we declare variables like (type name;). This notifies the compiler that we will use the name to refer to data whose type is type. With a primitive variable, this declaration also reserves the proper amount of memory for the variable. So for reference variables , the type must be strictly a concrete class name. In general, we canâ€™t create objects of an abstract class or an interface.\n",
