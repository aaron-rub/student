The main method is now used as a driver/tester, by making an instance of the class.  Thus, it creates an Object using the HelloObject() constructor.

    "This last example adds to the basics of the Java anatomy.  The Class now contains two constructors and a setter to go with the getter.  Also, observe the driver/tester now contains two objects that are initialized differently, 0 and 1 argument constructor.  Look at the usage of the \"this\" prefix.  The \"this\" keyword helps in clarification between instance and local variable.\n",

    "- \"local variable\" is a variable that is passed to the method in this example, see the 1 argument constructor as it has a local variable \"String hello\"\n",
    "- \"dynamic\" versus \"static\" is something that has option to change, static never changes.  A class (blueprint) and objects (instance of blueprint) are generally intended to be dynamic.  Constructors and Setters are used to dynamically change the content of an object.\n",
